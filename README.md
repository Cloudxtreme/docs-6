About JumpScale
===================

[JumpScale](http://www.jumpscale.com/) is **A cloud automation product** and a branch from what used to be Pylabs. About 5 years ago Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product which was acquired by
[SUN Microsystems](http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.html) from a company called [Q-Layer](http://incubaid.com/successes/Q-Layer/). In the mean time we are 3 versions further and we rebranded to [JumpScale](http://www.jumpscale.com/).

Main Features
-------------
- a large library of convencience functions for mainly system automation
- portal framework (markdown & confluence format, very easy to create macro's)
- osis = object storage & indexing system (db layer on top of mongogb, mysql, postgreswl, ...)
- a system abstraction layer to manage many applications, services & clouds
- a ssh management layer (use ssh to manage large amounts of apps, os'es, ...)
- a package management system (called at your service (AYS))
- a full life cycle management system for apps (called at your service (AYS))
- a agent & agentcontroller (1 in python, 1 in golang) for managing thousands of nodes
- a framework to manage a grid of nodes like 1 with lots of macro's created for the portal
- a rest based application server (as part of the portal)
- lots of best practicices how to do things
- a portforwarding system to allow secure access to all your services even if behind firewalls (part of agentcontroller 2)

    Jumpscale is the result of 15 years of developing cloud products & tools to support us.
    Its being used in most of our products in the incubaid group.
    We are 100% committed to make this an even more mature framework with community backing (which is today not the case mainly because of the poor documentation)

roadmap
--------
- 8.0 (Q4 2015)
    - we are porting certain area's to golang
        - our agent/agentcontroller (done but still need to integrate in our portal)
    - lots better documentation, looking for help, over the years this documentation came together but its not consistent enough & not clear enough, we need lots of improvements. 
    - new version of osis (based on even) and fully integrated in our portal
    - safekeeper (an exciting system to securely remotely manage an environment)
    - reactivate our cloudrobot (is message based robot for automating your daily sysadmin life)
    - ays (at your service)
        - better support for docker
        - UI in portal on top of ays
        - bot integration (by means of telegram)
        - maybe toml support in stead of our own hrd (maybe)
    - support for more OS'es
        - more proven support for mac & windows (its +- working today)
        - non sandboxed install on ubuntu
        - more linuxes (its working on most already today)
- 8.1
    - we are porting certain area's to golang
        - portal framework
        - ays
    - ...
