### AtYourService remote execution

AtYourService allow you to create and manage a full environment.
In order to be able to contact the remote machines, you need to write the services that will handle these communications.

To have an idea of what can be created, lets have a look at a concrete example.

Example of a remote node installation

**Through the cmdline**
```
# First, node service should be installed
# (Will define everything needed to connect to and manage a remote node)

# Notice the usage of "--data" to pass arguments directly to the ays
# instance to avoid being asked configuration questions during installation.

ays init -n node.local -i local --data 'jumpscale.install:False jumpscale.update:False node.tcp.addr:localhost'


# By defining the node as the parent of the singlenode_portal service,
# it will be installed on that node.

ays init -n singlenode_portal --parent '!local@node'


# Now ays preparations are ready to be applied

ays apply

```



**Through a script**
```python
from JumpScale import j

# creation of a node

data = {
    'jumpscale.install': False,
    'jumpscale.update': False
    'node.tcp.addr': "localhost"
}

node = j.atyourservice.new(name='node.local', args=data)
node.init()

# Service should be created with the node as a parent, indicating it
# should be installed on the previously defined node

allinone = j.atyourservice.new(name='singlenode_portal', args=data, parent=node)
allinone.init()

# Apply the changes prepared

j.atyourservice.apply()
```

Have a look at the services template used in this example :
- [node.local](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays_jumpscale7/tree/ays_unstable/_ays/node.local)
- [singlenode_portal](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays_jumpscale7/tree/ays_unstable/_jumpscale/singlenode_portal)
