AYS Parent/Child relationship
-------------------------------

A service can be a parent for other services. It's a way of organizing your services and grouping them.

Child services are created under the directory of the parent.
```
# Create a parent node
ays init -n node.local -i test --data 'jumpscale.install:False jumpscale.update:False'

# Init a service that has the node as its parent:
ays init -n test --parent '!test@node'

# Apply these changes
ays apply


# File structure will look like this:
-- node!test
    |-- actions.py
    |-- instance.hrd
    |-- instance_old.hrd
    |-- rolename!test
    |   |-- actions.py
    |   |-- instance.hrd
    |   |-- instance_old.hrd
    |   |-- state.hrd
    |   `-- template.hrd
    |-- state.hrd
    |-- template.hrd
    |-- test4!test
    |   |-- actions.py
    |   |-- instance.hrd
    |   |-- instance_old.hrd
    |   |-- state.hrd
    |   `-- template.hrd
    |-- test5!test
    |   |-- actions.py
    |   |-- instance.hrd
    |   |-- instance_old.hrd
    |   |-- state.hrd
    |   `-- template.hrd
    `-- test!test
        |-- actions.py
        |-- instance.hrd
        |-- instance_old.hrd
        |-- state.hrd
        `-- template.hrd

```

A service is also identified by its parent, so two services with the same domain/name/instance can exits if they have different parents.

This is useful for grouping services of a certain location/node together. Then, performing any action is made easier.

#To create a nested child service:
```
# First, create the parent
# Note that the parent can be any service
ays install -n location -i europe --data 'instance.name:Europe'

# Now create a child service with its parent the created location service
ays install -n redis -i test --parent location!europe

# You can even create a child nested within the child that you just created by
ays install -n redis -i test --parent location!europe:redis!test
# Notice that you could have just specified the parent to be --parent redis!test because at that point you only have the one.

# Our current structure looks like this:
# location__europe
# |
# | - redis__test
#     | action.py
#     | service.hrd
#     | - redis__test
#          | action.py
#          | service.hrd
# | action.py
# | service.hrd


# To perform an action on location__europe/redis__test specifically without matching on location__europe/redis__test/redis__test, you'll have to use the '--immediate' argument. This implies that the parent is precisely the one specified.
ays start -n redis -i test --parent location!europe --immediate

```
