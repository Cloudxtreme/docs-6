## AYS Actions

* Manages the lifecycle of your AYS
* you need to implement one or more methods (actions) on your atyourservice actions.py file

### Example:

 ```python
class ActionsBase():
    """
    implement methods of this class to change behaviour of lifecycle management of service
    """


    def init_pre(self,serviceObj):
        """
        gets executed before init happens of this ays
        use this method to manipulate the arguments which are given or already part of ays instance
        this is done as first action on an ays, even at central location 

        example how to use

        ```
        #call parent, to make sure std init_post is executed 
        ActionsBase.init_pre(self,serviceObj)
        if serviceObj.name.startswith("node"):
            serviceObj.hrd.set("something","data") #can ofcourse come from everywhere

        ```        

        """

    def init_post(self,serviceObj):
        """
        gets executed after init happens of all ays recipe's
        use this method to manipulate the hrd's as they are applied (inited) after init

        default we register the service to the nameservice

        if nameserver has not been consumed then will check if there is one nameserver already deployed (init) and use that one
        this action can ofcourse also be overruled to do a custom registration

        the name used for registration is

            $instance.$firstpartaysname.$ns.domain
            - $instance is name instance
            - $firstpartyaysname is the name of the ays before first . e.g node.ssh becomes 'node'
            - $ns.domain is the specified domain in the nameserver service

        example how to use
        
        ```
        #call parent, to make sure std init_post is executed 
        ActionsBase.init_post(self,serviceObj)
        serviceObj.hrd.set("something","data") #can ofcourse come from everywhere
