# Recipe arguments


Some special AtYourService recipe args
```
ns.enable = True
hrd.return = True
```

- ns.enable means we will be using the nameservice service, is not relevant for all services
- hrd.return means that after install the hrd needs to be copied back to the site from which we install (only relevant for remote working)
