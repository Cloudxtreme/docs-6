## listen
The agencontroller can listen on multiple addresses. Specify a `[[listen]]` block for every address to listen on.

### tls
A `[[listen.tls]]` block enables HTTPS connections on the address supplied in the parent `[[listen]]` block.
On production environments this should always be configured.

* **cert** is the certificate file. 
If the certificate is signed by a CA, this certificate file should be a concatenation of the server's certificate followed by the CA's certificate.
* **key** is the server's private key file which matches the certificate file.


The cert and key files must contain PEM encoded data.

Multiple `[[listen.tls]]` blocks may be specified to allow multiple dns entries and corresponding certificates to be served from the same address.
