## Error Condition Objects
An overview of ECOs reported anywhere in the grid is shown in the ECOs page [http:localhost:82/grid/ecos]

Shows errors that occurred on all nodes of the grid.
This is particularly useful in hunting down any misbehavior that takes place.

The ECOs are sortable by time of occurrence, level, originating app name, node ID and grid ID (its address in essence)

Each of the ECOs further show helpful details such as backtraces, files where they occurred, number of occurrences and so on.
