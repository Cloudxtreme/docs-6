Installing the Portal
=====================

The JumpScale portal requires the JumpScale framework to be installed.
So if you didn't do so [install JumpScale](http://github.com/Jumpscale/jumpscale_core7/wiki/Install).

```shell
# this will install portal and all it dependencies on a single node.
ays install -n singlenode_portal
```

Start the portal by starting the necessary processes:

```shell
ays start
```
