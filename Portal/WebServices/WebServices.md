Web Services
============

Rest Services are provided under `<ip>/rest` and `<ip>/restmachine`

These allow actor methods to be exposed over rest.
For human usage, [Rest Services](RestWebServices) are convinient and easy to use.
For machines, [RestMachine Services](RestMachineServices) give a machine-readable output.
