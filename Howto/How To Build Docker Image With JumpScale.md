#Building your own docker image

We made this task very easy for you. You just need to get the [dockers](https://github.com/Jumpscale/dockers) repository and follow the build instructions below. Also you can customize your image and build it the same way as the examples in the repo.

To start building first clone and prepare the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jumpscale/dockers.git
cd dockers
git submodule init
```
